# Burger Eater

## Description

This application lets you add burgers you want to eat, then click a button to move the burger to another list once it's been eaten. After a burger has been eaten, it can then be deleted and removed from the list. 

I loosely used the in-class CatsApp activity as a template for this assignment. This was my first assignment using handlebars and uring orm. I struggled keeping up with all the different files and making sure that all the correct terms lined up correctly, but it was more satisfying when I would get things to work correctly. 

## Installation
This application requires you to download the express, mysql, and express-handlebars npm packages. Along with that, the user needs to have a connection to the mySQL server in order to create the database and tables needed for this application. Please be sure to check your server connectivity before trying to run this application.
